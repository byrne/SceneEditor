1.3- Added support for WindowedApplication (previously only Application
        was supported). Added ENABLE_CONFIRM/CONFIRM_CLOSING notes that give 
        you a hook into the process of closing a window. Refactored the note
        naming scheme. Major thanks to Ondina for the work she did on this:

1.2.1 - Refactored constructor logic into onRegister.

1.2   - Added MultiCore support. No Standard version functionality changes
        except renaming source tree. So no need to migrate Standard version
        apps to 1.2.

1.1   - Moved source code into src folder. Updated XML Database swc, which
        was updated for the same refactoring.

1.0   - Initial release. Works with AIR Beta 3 and PureMVC 2.0 Extracted
        from the CodePeek demo.
